# Color Palette
This is the front end of our Color Palette application. Frida watches over you as you add randomly generated palettes to previous projects. Or if you are feeling bold, you can add a whole new project. Call it whatever you want and throw in as many color palettes in there as you would like. Design the color schemes for your whole house. If you are a designer, keep track of all your preferred color schemes. We hope Frida inspires you to have fun with our Color Palette!<br>
